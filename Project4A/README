Beaglebone S/N: BBGW17052055
Mac: 2CF7F1066795


Makefile: There is only one target in it:

              I hanged the name (showed using 'hostname') and have connected to wifi

          been successfully copied to the beaglebone using scp command

Problems Experienced:
Even after setting the hostname to 504958165.lasr.cs.ucla.edu, it was not showing up
on the beaglebone terminal. It showed the old hostname. In order to resolve this issue,
I had to restart my Beaglebone. The issue being resolved can be seen in git.png
