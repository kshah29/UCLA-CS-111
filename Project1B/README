lab1b-client.c: It will connect to the server using the port number given.
                Client sends the input from keyboard and sends it to server
                and also output to the STDOUT. Input from the socket is sent
                to display. If encrypt option is provided, we encrypt the
                message sent and decrypt the message received. If log option
                is used, we log all the communications in the log file. It
                record outgoing data post-encryption and incoming data
                pre-decryption.


lab1b-server.c: It connects with client. Forks a new process and run shell on
                it. It  receives the client's commands and send them to the shell,
                and will "serve" the client If encrypt option is provided, we
                encrypt the message sent and decrypt the message received.


Makefile: There are 3 targets in it:
          default: compiles both the client and server c files to create a binary file
          clean: deletes all unnecessary files
          dist: creates a tarball containing all the required files for submission
