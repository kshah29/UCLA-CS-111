lab0.c: Optional arguments for segfault, catch and input file and output file are given to the program.
        The file descriptor for input file and output file are change to 0 and 1 respectively. A
        signalhandler function is setup if catch option is passed. Segmentation fault error is caused
        if segfault is passed. The program copies content from file descriptor 0 to files descriptor 1.


Makefile: There are 4 targets in it. The default target compiles the c file and creates a binary file.
          The check target runs some smoke tests to check if the program satisfies all requirement.
          The clean section deletes all unnecessary files. The dist target creates a tarball
          containing all the required files for submission.


backtrace.png: This is  a screenshot to show the Segmentation fault error and the stack when the segfault
               option is passed. The command bt (backtrace) is used, it brings us to the statement which
               caused segmentation fault error.


breakpoint.png: This is a screenshot to show that the variable which caused segmentation fault was
                null before its assignment. A break (breakpoint) is set for the bad assignment and
                the value of the variable is printed (print c) thereafter.



Smoke Tests:

            1. Checked for exit code 0 while copying from one file to another. Compared both
               the files to check if the content is same.

            2. Checked for exit code 0 while copying from stdin to stdout. Compared the standard
               input and standard output to check if the content is same.

            3. Checked for exit code 1 when unrecognized option is passed.

            4. Checked for exit code 2 when invalid input file is passed (file doesn't exist).

            5. Checked for exit code 3 when invalid output file is passed (file doesn't have
               write permissions).

            6. Checked for exit code 4 when options segfault and catch is passed (Segmentation fault
               was caused, caught and received)
