lab1a.c: This c program supports option shell which accepts arguments for a shell program.
          It changes terminal settings and restores it before exiting.
          If shell option is used, it will make a new process using fork and run the shell
          program given. Input from shell is written to STDOUT. Input from keyboard (STDIN)
          is written to STDOUT and then to the shell.
          If shell option is not used, characters are read and then outputted right after.


Makefile: There are 3 targets in it:
          default: compiles the c file and creates a binary file
          clean: deletes all unnecessary files
          dist: creates a tarball containing all the required files for submission
